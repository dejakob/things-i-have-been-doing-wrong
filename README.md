# things-i-have-been-doing-wrong

As I like to point out things that others are doing wrong, I think it’s time I should also point out what I’ve been doing wrong in the last two years. As mentioned in a blog before, I am already doing my fourth job on two years and can only imagine what people think of that. On the bright side, a wise man once told me that it’s ok to make mistakes as long as you learn something from it. (The wise man was head of my college and the wise words were told during my graduation).

## Massive//Media
Back when I was in my puberty, scratching zits all day, I loved a social network called Netlog. It was *the thing* at the time, everyone had a profile and all pupils were spending an insane amount of time on it. I always wondered how the website was built and what it would be like to work for such a company. It was a true childhood dream and somehow, I figured out a way to sign a contract at that particular company.

However, dreams mostly don't equal reality that much. I never actually worked on the product 'Netlog', but on the new platform 'Twoo'. My expectations were unrealistic at the time. I disagreed on most technical decisions that were made and felt misplaced in the company.

My biggest mistake here: I never tried fixing the problems I had with company or the way they worked. Maybe I wasn't brave enough to speak up, maybe not mature enough, who will tell? As a result I grew further and further away from the company and my colleagues. The lesson here is that I should fix issues instead of ignoring them.

Another mistake might be that I needed to quit my job as I did not like it at the time. If you don't enjoy what you're doing, what's the point? I eventually got fired, but already applied at another company called Showpad.

## Showpad
I came in contact with Showpad for the first time when I was on a trip to San Francisco as an alumnus of Howest. I always had this American dream thing, as I also went on an internship to Washington DC and had the time of my life. I applied for a job in the San Francisco office, but got eventually hired in the Ghent office.

I felt myself far more conformable with their technical decisions and enjoyed learning Angular. It's safe to say I actually did learn a lot during my job at Showpad. I even reused some knowledge I've learned there in other companies later on.

As a competitive person, I always wanted my work to be better than the work of anyone else. At my college, I won two awards and graduated with a high distinction. My mind was completely focused on competing and being the best at everything. In a startup, you also need to compete, but you need to compete together.

Another weird thing in my mindset was that I thought I could do everything. I still think I can, just not in one day. While working, I was always feeling an insane amount of stress of getting the job done. I sometimes worked 2 or even 3 times the amount of hours I was supposed to and even allowed to. I knew there were studies about that you could only work a limited amount of hours on a day, but I kept thinking I was superman, who could do what others couldn't.

Unfortunately, if you keep on working without enough relaxation, you cannot think clearly. The quality of your work goes down, without you even noticing it. Also, your perspectives about pretty much everything become unclear and sometimes even dark. I eventually started fixing that, while working at Showpad and visited a psychologist. I also started doing some sport every now and then.

Despite the fact that I was starting to fix things, I got fired again. For being too competitive, bad communication and not being a team player.

## Tsjing
I had to apply for a job ... again ...
This time, I wanted to try a smaller startup. As I completely live for my job sometimes, I thought it would be a better idea to work at a place where I could have more impact.

I started to do some things differently. I started working smarter instead of harder: less hours and more work done. I went skating three times a week to release all stress that came along with the job. I also went to more tech meetups to socialise with other devs. My results were way better in my opinion and I also improved my skills here. That might be the reason why Tsjing was the first company I didn't get fired.

However, at a certain point in time, I decided that Tsjing had no longer exciting challenges to offer for me and quitted myself.

## FLAVR
And here I am, working at FLAVR, my fourth job. I really like the concept of the company and try to improve it in any technical way. I will just try to keep in mind that...

* I am not superman
* It's better to work smarter, not harder
* I am a developer and my job is fixing problems
* I need time to relax
* Meetups are amazing
* Skating is the solution to everything
* And if something is not going right: I should speak up

As I learned a lot of things the hard way, I am sharing this blog and hope someone, besides myself, can learn from my mistakes. #humanknowledgebelongstotheworld
